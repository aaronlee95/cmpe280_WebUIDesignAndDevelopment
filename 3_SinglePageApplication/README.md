README for the Single Page Web Application  assignment using AJAX, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

Use an IDE (i.e. Sublime) to launch a local server to view the webpage.

1. From "File", select "Open Folder" and select this project.
2. Make sure you have the "SublimeServer" installed using Sublime's Package Control.
3. After completing the install, select the following:
    Browser Sync > Start File > index.html
4. Then, Select Launch to start the server.
5. Wait for the server to pop up from your default browser. If nothing pops up, open a new web page,
   and in the address bar, type the following:
        localhost:3000/index.html
6. You should now be on the home page of the Single Page Web Application.
